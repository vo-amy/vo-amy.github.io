In this post, I'll use python to show off different properties of a dataset.

```{R}
quakes <- quakes
```

We can use python to find the mean of the numeric values in quakes
```{python}
import numpy as np
#The mean of the latitudes is
r.quakes.lat.mean()
#The mean of the longitudes is
r.quakes.long.mean()
#The mean of the depths is
r.quakes.depth.mean()
#The mean of the magnitudes is
r.quakes.mag.mean()
```

We can use python to find the median of the numeric values in quakes
```{python}
#The median of the latitudes is
r.quakes.lat.median()
#The median of the longitudes is
r.quakes.long.median()
#The median of the depths is
r.quakes.depth.median()
#The median of the magnitudes is
r.quakes.mag.median()
```

We can use python to find the standard deviation of the numeric values in quakes
```{python}
#The standard deviation of the latitudes is
np.std(r.quakes.lat)
#The standard deviation of the longitudes is
r.quakes.long.median()
#The standard deviation of the depths is
r.quakes.depth.median()
#The standard deviation of the magnitudes is
r.quakes.mag.median()
```

We can also find properties of datasets related to other properties
```{python}
# The median of the magnitudes of quakes with longitude greater than 175
r.quakes[r.quakes.long>175].mag.median()

# The mean of the latitudes of quakes with depth less than 200
r.quakes[r.quakes.depth<200].lat.mean()
```
